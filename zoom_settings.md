# Zoom Setting Recommendations 

This guide is here to offer assistance dealing with the many settings of Zoom. Through using Zoom, we have made a few changes to the default settings; Here is that list. 

# Getting to the Settings

To get to your general settings, click on the small gear located at the top right of your Zoom home screen.

Once you have opened up the settings menu, we will find the general settings. 

## General Settings

Changes from default.

## Chat

![chat](chat.png) 

This section is deceptive because Zoom chat has nothing to do with the chat that is happening within the meeting.  To find the Zoom chat, you have to access it from the home screen.  We made some changes during our initial exploration but have never used the chat feature within Zoom since. 

- Show voice message button (On)
- Show code snipped button (On)

## Background and Filters

We have made no changes other than selecting the virtual background of your choice.  The University has recently released a helpful tool for creating a custom background. It can be found [here.](https://appcenter.chicagobooth.edu/PublicApps/ZoomNames/)

## Recording
